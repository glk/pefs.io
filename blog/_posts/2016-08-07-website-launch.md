title: PEFS website launch
---

Hello everyone,

We are excited to announce an official launch of PEFS website: [pefs.io](http://pefs.io)!

PEFS (Private Encrypted File System) is a kernel level stacked cryptographic file system for FreeBSD.

The purpose of the website is to provide our visitors with the most relevant and up-to-date information about PEFS project development, and promote PEFS beyond the open-source community.

In this blog, we are planning to publish the latest news about PEFS as well as our thoughts on secure data storage and cryptography topics.

<br/>

Feel free to send your feedback to <a href="mailto:contact@pefs.io">contact@pefs.io</a>. 


Thank you,  
PEFS team
